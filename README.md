# MADRID
MADRID is designed to be a type-safe, strictly typed game engine for Urban Arts games.
## Why make something new?
The team needed something specific and tailored to our needs.
## What makes it different?
- Static type checking
- Incorporation of a (currently barebones) "code execution environment" which allows Game and Engine components to leverage custom packages, definitions and middleware systems without import hassle.
- "Hijacks" standard ROBLOX libraries to be more tailored to what we need.
- Integration of some lifecycle techniques, like init, main, and update.
- Performant parallel connections.
- Runner thread scripts.
- Memory management/threading management (todo)...
- Integrated networking via RED (barebones)
- TODO: state replication, etcetera
- Engine plugin components/incorporate things like Bloxstrap rpc, incorporate YORK firebase system into this
## Issues/limitations
- Currently it is barebones and not production grade but I am willing to fulfill this product.
- Will only be updated as needed for DESERT STEEL.
